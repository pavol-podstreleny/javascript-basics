/**
 * Variables
 */

// In past we use var keyword to declare variable
// However there are some probles with it which
// we will discuss later

let name;
console.log(name); // => Undefined
name = "Palo";
console.log(name); // => Palo

// Cannot be a reserved keyword
// Should be meaningful
// Cannot start with a number (1name)
// Cannot contain a space or hyphen (-)
// We use cammel case notation
// variables are case sensitive
// It's better to declare variables on single lines

let firstName = "Mosh";
let lastName = "Hamedani";
